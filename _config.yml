title: OpusNoia is not a Job! It is a Blog!
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
 OpusNoia is not job. Instead, it is a blog. In reality, it is something much more than that: it is a hobby! 
 A hobby that helps me stay sharp and alive. Even when everything else seems pointless, this is a sign of freedom.
